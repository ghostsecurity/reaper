Reaper by [Ghost Security](https://ghost.security) is a modern, lightweight, and deadly effective open-source application security testing frameworkâ€”engineered by humans and primed for AI. Reaper slashes through the complexities of app security testing, bringing together reconnaissance, request proxying, request tampering/replay, active testing, vulnerability validation, live collaboration, and reporting into a *killer* workflow. When paired with an AI Agent, Reaper reaps even greater rewards, transforming into a powerful engine that slays application vulnerabilities with precision and efficiency.

## ðŸ‘» About

Reaper was created to give appsec analysts, pentesters, and bug bounty hunters a single, razor-sharp tool that brings together every phase of application security testing into one efficient workflow. It slashes through the manual, time-intensive steps required to uncover application vulnerabilities, exorcising the lingering demons of application security with precision.

While existing tools like Burp Suite, Zap, Subfinder, and Katana tackle individual stages of the testing lifecycle well, Reaper wields a scythe where others use scissors, stitching the entire process back together with cutting-edge technology.

Built for orchestration by both humans and AI, Reaper transforms appsec testing into a streamlined, high-speed process. LLM-powered AI Agents step in as tireless team members, mowing through tedious tasks that would take hours for a human analyst, in mere seconds. Picture having a teammate who never sleeps, understands the depths of application security, and works at lightning speed, assisting with test parameter tuning, data analysis, findings summaries, and reporting ðŸ¤¤.
