# How to Hack Ghostbank with Reaper
Welcome to your journey into application security with Ghost Security's Reaper! This guide will take you step-by-step through the process of testing security vulnerabilities in Ghostbank, our fictional banking app.

In this exercise, your goal is to successfully hack Ghostbank, a fictional banking application. You'll achieve this by transferring funds from all other customer accounts into your own, using the powerful tools provided by Ghost Security's Reaper. This exercise is designed to help you understand key application security concepts and practice your skills in a controlled environment.


## Steps

1. [Start Reaper](#1-start-reaper)
2. [Add a Domain](#2-add-a-domain)
3. [Capture Traffic](#3-capture-traffic)
4. [Fuzz Manually](#4-fuzz-manually)
5. [Automated Test](#5-automated-test)

## 0. Prerequisites

Before you dive in, ensure you have everything set up for a smooth operation. Hereâ€™s what you need:

1. [Clone the Reaper repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).
2. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
3. Have two web browsers ready. We recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/) for using Reaper and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for using Ghostbank.

## 1. Start Reaper
First things first, let's get Reaper up and running.

1. From a command line, navigate to the Reaper directory and run `docker compose up`. 
2. In a web browser (we recommend Chrome), navigate to [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to reach the Reaper UI.
3. Enter a username (or use the default Reaper Admin) and click *Sign in*.

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/img/reaper_login.png" width="400" /></p>

You will land on the Scan page, where we will get started by adding a domain!

## 2. Add a Domain
Let's add a Domain and discover the available hosts.

1. On the *Scan* tab, click *Add Domain*.
2. Enter `ghostbank.net`.
3. Leave the *Auto-scan* option enabled and click *Add and scan*.

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/img/reaper_add_domain.png" width="400" /></p>

You will see *ghostbank.net* in the Domain list. When the scan completes, you can click on *ghostbank.net* to view the discovered hosts. By default, Reaper will only show live hosts.

## 3. Capture Traffic
Now, let's get to the good stuff. We are going to set up a proxy in Firefox, then log in to Ghostbank and initiate a fund transfer. Reaper's proxy will capture the traffic, allowing us to inspect, replay, and modify the requests.

**Add Reaper's Certificate to Firefox's Trusted Authority Store**

1. Open Firefox.
2. In the URL bar, enter `about:preferences` (or open the app menu and click *Settings*).
3. Search for `cert` in the *Find in Settings* input.
4. Click *View Certificates...*
5. Under the *Authorities* tab, click *Import...*
6. Navigate to the `/reaper/tls` directory and select the `ca.pem` file.
7. In the dialog that pops up, check *Trust this CA to identify websites* and click Ok.
8. You should see the *Ghost Security, Inc > reaper.ghostsecurity.com* entry. 
9. Click Ok.

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/img/import_reaper_cert_firefox.png" width="400" /></p>

**Firefox Proxy Configuration**
1. Open Firefox.
2. In the URL bar, enter `about:preferences` (or open the app menu and click *Settings*).
3. Search for `proxy` on the Settings page. *Network Settings* should show up.
4. Click *Settings*.
5. Select *Manual proxy configuration*.
6. Enter `localhost` in the HTTP Proxy field and `8080` in the Port field.
7. Select *Also use this proxy for HTTPS*.
8. Click *OK*.

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/img/firefox_proxy_settings.png" width="400" /></p>

**Capturing Traffic in Reaper**
1. Return to Reaper in Chrome and switch to the *Explore* tab.
2. Make sure the proxy is on (you'll see *Proxy on*).
3. Switch back to Firefox and browse to `https://ghostbank.net`.
4. Log in to Ghostbank.
5. Initiate a funds transfer by entering $10 and clicking *Transfer*. You may need to switch the From and To accounts.
6. Switch back to Chrome. You should see a list of captured requests!

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/img/captured_requests.png" width="400" /></p>

You now have valid requests that we can replay and modify -- good work!

## 4. Fuzz Manually
*[Fuzzing](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing)* is a software testing method wherein a human or program provides invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. We are going to fuzz the Transfer API in Ghostbank to see if we can transfer funds from a different customer's account into our own account. But first, let's simply replay and modify our original transfer request.

**Replay Original and Modified Requests**
1. Go to the *Replay* tab in Reaper. You should see a variety of requests captured from our previous interaction with Ghostbank.
2. Search for `transfer` and click on the `/api/v3/transfer` endpoint.
3. You should see the *Request Headers* and *Request Body*. Notice there are three inputs in the *Request Body*: `account_to`, `account_from`, and `amount`.
4. Click the *Replay original* button.
5. In Firefox, disable the proxy (Settings > Network Settings > Settings > No Proxy > OK).
6. Refresh the Ghostbank page. You should see a new transfer from replaying the request in Reaper.
7. Return to Reaper and change the `amount` to `20` in the Request Body.
8. Click *Replay modified*.
9. Switch back to Firefox and refresh Ghostbank. You should see another transfer, this time for $20!

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/img/replay_modified.png" width="500" /></p>

Now that we know we can replay and modify requests, let's see if we can loot some cash from someone else's account by fuzzing the `account_from` field. 

**Fuzz the Account From Input**
1. In Reaper, try changing the `account_from` field to another three digit integer.
2. Click *Replay modified*.
3. Refresh the page in Ghostbank and check for a new transfer. If there is no new transfer, then the `account_from` ID provided in the request was not valid.
4. Repeat steps 1-3, changing the `account_from` value, until you find a valid account ID and loot some funds!

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/img/fuzz_manually.png" width="500" /></p>

Congratulations! You've learned how to capture traffic, modify requests, and find a vulnerability in Ghostbank! This is an *[Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)* vulnerability, sometimes known as *[Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/)*, meaning a user may modify or access objects that they do not have permission to access. These vulnerabilities occur due to missing access control checks. In our example, Ghostbank "customers" are able to access funds in another customer's account.

Now that we've done this the hard way and understand the concept, let's unleash Reaper to test for an IDOR/BOLA vulnerability automatically!

## 5. Automated Test

Since manually changing inputs is time-consuming and error prone, we've built an automated fuzzing capability into Reaper. Let's give it a spin.

1. Switch to the *Tests* tab in Reaper.
2. Search for `transfer` and select the `/api/v3/transfer` endpoint.
3. Click the *Create a test* button.
4. Choose *Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR/BOLA)* from the *Test type* menu.
5. Check the `account_from` in the *Included parameters* list.
6. Click *Start test*!

Reaper will automatically start modifying the transfer request, changing the `account_from` input with each attempt. Sit back and let Reaper do the work!

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/img/create_bola_test.png" width="500" /></p>

When the test completes, you will see several successful requests listed in Reaper. Go back to Firefox and refresh Ghostbank. You should see *a lot* of transfers.
