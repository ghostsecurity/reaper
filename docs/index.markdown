## What can I do with Reaper?

Reaper is a work in progress, but it's already capable of a lot. Here's a quick overview of some things you can do:

- Intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses
- Save and categorise HTTP requests/responses for later examination/reuse
- Manage multiple projects and project-specific settings using workspaces
- Incrementally craft workflows to attack web applications using our unique GUI
- Automate simple tasks like fuzzing, brute-forcing etc.
- Perform automated attacks against web applications
- Create, share and collaborate on custom workflows to automate your testing
