## Configuration

Reaper ships with a default configuration that should work for most users. However, you may wish to customise Reaper's
behaviour.

There are two main ways to configure Reaper:

- Workspace configuration: The workspace configuration is specific to a single workspace. You can configure a workspace
  by hitting the workspace dropdown in the top right of the GUI, or the `Edit` option in the dropdown on the workspace
  selection menu.
- Global configuration: The global configuration is shared across all workspaces. You can configure the global
  configuration by hitting the cog symbol on the bottom left of the GUI (you must select a workspace first).
